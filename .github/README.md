Let's face it, seeing is believing and especially with base16 schemes, you want to know before you go through the trouble of setting all your apps up with it that you like it. So here is a gallery of the theme colors in action, as well as some of the artwork I have made to accompany the scheme and as backgrounds in my customized Linux environments that employ it
